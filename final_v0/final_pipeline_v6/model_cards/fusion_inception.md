# FileBagFusionInception

- Machine ID: `fusion_inception`
- Scientific status: `reference_file_level_fusion`
- Representation mode: `fusion`
- Eligible signal routes: `direct_x_filter`, `identity_direct`
- Evaluation unit: participant after window→file, then config-dependent Line A equal-files or Line B equal-role-families aggregation
- Current classifier role scope: SQI off; only B and R are admitted
- Execution status: registered/constructible; scientific benchmark not run
- Independent test: absent; `independent_test=false`

## Identity and deviation

Uses an Inception file encoder and concatenates the file vector only after pooling.

This card describes only implemented interfaces and naming boundaries. The existence
of an architecture, passing unit tests, and historical scores are not V2 performance evidence.

## Limitations

- No independent frailty test set is available; formal scores must be named oof_validation_*.
- No V2 performance is claimed until the same frozen 5×5 participant protocol is run.
- The implementation is registered/constructible; the scientific benchmark has not been run.
- The signal member remains a project single-network port.

## Required provenance

Every formal result must bind participant/file/role, repeat/fold/seed, config hash,
manifest and fold hashes, preprocessing and feature hashes, signal route, aggregation,
model state, environment, and coverage. Every formal result must bind all identities listed above.
